The climate of Chicago is classified as humid continental (Köppen Dfa), with all four seasons distinctly represented: wet springs; hot, and often humid summers; pleasant autumns; and cold winters. Annual precipitation is average, and reaches its lowest points in the months of January and February, and peaks in the months of May and June.

					    Winter in Chicago proves quite variable: Seasonal snowfall in the city has ranged from 9.8 inches (24.9 cm) (in 1920–21) up to 89.7 in (228 cm) (in 1978–79).[9] Most winters produce a few snow falls during the season in light accumulations of around 2 in (5.1 cm), an amount often lighter than what occurs during the same snowstorms in cities on the other (leeward) side of Lake Michigan. The city rarely receives the lake-effect snow that falls on these leeward communities because it is on the windward side of the lake, meaning prevailing westerlies that cross the region pick up moisture from Lake Michigan only after passing Chicago. However, every three years or so northeasterly winds during the winter cause Chicago to experience a heavier snowstorm that can produce over 10 in (25 cm) of snow over a 1–3 day period, a level of snowfall more commonly seen in cities on the other side of the lake such as Grand Rapids, Michigan, Kalamazoo, Michigan, and South Bend, Indiana.

Winter temperatures can vary wildly within the span of one week. The daily average temperature in January at Midway Airport is 24.8 °F (−4.0 °C). Temperatures drop to or below 0 °F (−18 °C) on 5.5 nights annually at Midway and 8.2 nights at O'Hare, although subzero (°F) readings in the absence of snow cover are rare,[10] and the warming effect of Lake Michigan during the winter makes them less common on the lakefront than in more inland parts of the city. Highs reach 50 °F (10 °C) on 8.8 days from December to February at Midway, and though it is extremely rare, temperatures in late winter have surpassed 80 °F (27 °C). Every single recorded temperature above 80 °F (27 °C) in the winter has occurred in March. In 2012, there were eight days with temperatures 80 °F (27 °C)+ (with a ninth day occurring in many suburban areas) during the record-breaking March 2012 North American heat wave, although the last couple of 80 degree days occurred after the spring equinox on March 20.

Based on 30-year averages obtained from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center for the months of December, January and February, Weather Channel ranked Chicago the 6th coldest major U.S. city as of 2014.[11]
