			<h1>Welcome to Chicago</h1>
			<p>
				
				The climate of Chicago is classified as humid continental (Köppen Dfa), with all four seasons distinctly represented: wet springs; hot, and often humid summers; pleasant autumns; and cold winters. Annual precipitation is average, and reaches its lowest points in the months of January and February, and peaks in the months of May and June.
				Although Chicago is known as the Windy City, it is in fact less windy than many other major American cities. Average wind speeds range from 8 miles per hour (13 km/h) in late summer to 12 miles per hour (19 km/h) in spring months. The "Windy City" moniker is believed to actually be a reference to the boostering politicians of Chicago from the 1800s. The phrase may have also been created by Chicago tourism boosters promoting the city, suggesting that the cool breezes from Lake Michigan make Chicago an ideal summer destination.

			<p>CHICAGO EXTREMES
	    		The highest temperature ever recorded in Chicago is an unofficial 109 °F (43 °C) on July 24, 1934, at Midway Airport. The official reading of 105 °F (41 °C) for that day was taken at the University of Chicago campus near the waterfront, and is the highest official temperature ever recorded in the city.[17] Readings near the lake can be several degrees cooler than inland locations if lake breezes are present, which suggests that the higher unofficial reading may also be accurate. During the Chicago Heat Wave of 1995, official temperatures reached 104 °F (40 °C) at O'Hare Airport and 106 °F (41 °C) at Midway, but high humidity pushed the heat index to 15–20 °F (8–11 °C) above actual air temperatures. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Chicago is −27 °F (−33 °C) at O'Hare on January 20, 1985. On December 24, 1983, and January 18, 1994, the high temperature reached only −11 °F (−24 °C), and on July 29, 1916, the low temperature sank to only 85 °F (29 °C), both of which are all-time records.

				The greatest 24-hour precipitation was 6.86 in (174.2 mm) at O'Hare on July 23, 2011, while the heaviest 24-hour snowfall was 18.6 in (47.2 cm), again at O'Hare, on January 2, 1999. Daily snow depth has amassed as high as 29 in (74 cm) on January 14, 1979; As of 2013, January 1979 holds 8 of the top 10 daily snow depth measurements.
