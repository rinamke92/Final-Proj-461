The climate of Chicago is classified as humid continental (Köppen Dfa), with all four seasons distinctly represented: wet springs; hot, and often humid summers; pleasant autumns; and cold winters. Annual precipitation is average, and reaches its lowest points in the months of January and February, and peaks in the months of May and June.

					    Spring in Chicago is perhaps the city's wettest season: Winter conditions can persist well into April and even occasionally into May. Thunderstorms are especially prevalent in the spring time as the city's lakeside location makes it a center of conflicts between large volumes of warm and cold air, triggering many kinds of severe weather including hailstorms and small tornadoes.

						Although unlikely, large snowfalls do sometimes occur in late March and in early April. For example, in 1970, over 10 in (25 cm) of snow fell in a storm that occurred on April 1–2.[12] Twelve years later, Opening Day for the Chicago White Sox was postponed due to another 9 in (23 cm) snowfall that had occurred on April 5.[13] Even more extraordinary, over 18 in (46 cm) of snow fell on March 25–26, 1930, which remains one of the city's five biggest recorded snowstorms despite it occurring past the vernal equinox.[14] The average date for last measurable snowfall (≥0.1 in or 0.25 cm) is April 1.

						Temperatures can vary tremendously in the springtime; at 100 °F (38 °C), March is the month with the greatest span between the record high and low. At O'Hare, temperatures as low as 7 °F (−14 °C) and 31 °F (−1 °C) have been recorded as late as April 7 and May 21, respectively. Conversely, in official records, the earliest triple-digit (100°F or 38 °C) high occurred on June 1, 1934. More typically, the last freezing low of the season on average occurs on April 13 at Midway and ten days later at O'Hare.
